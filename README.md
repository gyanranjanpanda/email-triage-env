# Email Triage & Response Environment

An [OpenEnv](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/OpenEnv)-compliant reinforcement learning environment that simulates real-world email triage and response tasks. AI agents learn to classify, prioritize, and respond to emails across increasing difficulty levels.

## Why Email Triage?

Email triage is a genuine, high-impact business task performed millions of times daily by customer support teams, executive assistants, and operations staff. Unlike toy environments, this task requires:

- **Multi-dimensional classification** — category, priority, and urgency assessment
- **Nuanced decision-making** — should the agent respond, escalate, or ignore?
- **Language generation** — drafting appropriate responses with correct tone
- **Contextual reasoning** — legal notices need different handling than feature requests
- **Partial credit** — real-world performance isn't binary; a nearly-correct classification still has value

## Environment Overview

The agent receives a batch of simulated emails and must process each one by:

1. **Classifying** the email into one of 8 categories
2. **Assigning priority** (critical / high / medium / low)
3. **Deciding** whether to respond, ignore, or escalate
4. **Drafting** an appropriate response with the right tone
5. **Tagging** for organization

## Tasks (Easy → Medium → Hard)

### Task 1: `easy_triage` (Easy)
- **5 emails** — obvious spam, clear bug reports, straightforward inquiries
- Grading weighted toward classification accuracy (50%)
- Baseline score: **0.9636**

### Task 2: `medium_triage` (Medium)
- **7 emails** — phishing mixed with legitimate mail, angry complaints, ambiguous internal memos
- Grading shifts toward response quality and tone (35%)
- Baseline score: **0.9234**

### Task 3: `hard_triage` (Hard)
- **10 emails** — legal threats, press inquiries about data breaches, security incidents, investor communications, high-value customer retention
- Grading heavily weights content quality and escalation decisions (45%)
- Baseline score: **0.7189**

## Reward Function

Each action is graded across 5 dimensions with difficulty-dependent weights:

| Component           | Easy | Medium | Hard | Description |
|----------------------|------|--------|------|-------------|
| Classification       | 50%  | 30%    | 20%  | Category + priority accuracy |
| Response decision    | 25%  | 20%    | 15%  | Respond vs. ignore correctness |
| Tone                 | 10%  | 15%    | 20%  | Response tone appropriateness |
| Content quality      | 10%  | 20%    | 25%  | Key points coverage in response |
| Escalation           |  5%  | 15%    | 20%  | Correct escalation decisions |

Partial credit is awarded for close-but-not-perfect answers (e.g., classifying a complaint as an urgent bug still earns partial credit).

## Baseline Agent

The included baseline uses simple keyword matching:
- Scans email text for category-specific keywords (e.g., "production down" → urgent_bug)
- Applies priority based on severity signals
- Uses template responses per category
- Escalates all critical-priority items

This achieves reasonable scores on easy tasks but struggles with nuanced hard scenarios (legal notices, press inquiries), leaving significant room for improvement by learning agents.

## Reproducibility

All tasks use fixed random seeds, ensuring identical email batches across runs:
- `easy_triage`: seed=42
- `medium_triage`: seed=123
- `hard_triage`: seed=456

Running `python inference.py` will always produce:
```
easy   : 0.9636
medium : 0.9234
hard   : 0.7189
```
